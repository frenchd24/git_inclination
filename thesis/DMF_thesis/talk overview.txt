Talk overview:

Show a cool simulation or something to illustrate all the gas-galaxy interactions

What is going on here? Why do we care - accretion!

How do we measure this gas? - QSO absorption. Maybe show first Gunn-Peterson trough?

What have we learned since then? - A majority of the baryons in the universe exist in the IGM. Increased absorption near galaxies, increased line width near galaxies, but no information about orientation or rotation.

Thesis overview -> fix this.
Step 1. Get galaxy information
Step 2. Likelihood method -> inclination hints
Step 3. Rotation
Step 4. All the rest
