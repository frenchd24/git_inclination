This is not quite right. In W&S09 multiple absorbers within the 400 km/s
velocity window are not considering "one system", they are considered
separately, as is done here.
Dealing properly with the statistics of multiple closely-spaced lines
is always an issue since indeed it is not necessarily true that they
are not part of the same cloud, rather than independent clouds at
different locations along the line of sight that just have similar
velocities.
For this paper we are not ready to properly address it. For the main
future paper we will have to, especially when making comparisons to
previous work. But it will not be trivial.
The increased size of the final sample should help, though.

Not sure how to react to this.

True - we should remark that we end up looking at lower column density
and more distant HI than is often done at high redshift.
The high NHI LLS/metal lines tend to originate closer to the galaxy,
so are a-priori more likely to be co-rotating.
But also that we are working on the orientating angle business for
galaxies for which we don't have one yet.

We can do one more experiment, and maybe add something to Fig 5/6/7.
a different symbol (star) for sightlines within 1 Rvir. Although
that makes the sample smaller, it allows us to address this important
point. Probably just to say that the sample is not yet large enough
to assess any differences. But it allows to say that the R<Rvir
sample is the one to compare to previous work.

True, but it is what it is. I don't know how to respond.

Makes me guess Sancheeta Borthakur is the referee. Just do it.

We don't say that at low redshift one can "unambiguously" associate
absorbers. We says that one can make an "unbiased" sample. I.e., one
where non-detections can be accounted for.
It is always true that any associations can only be made down to a
given galaxy luminosity limit. At low redshift that limit is so low
that even if there is a small, missed, galaxy next to a large one
the gas properties should still be mostly determined by the large galaxy.
This is less clear cut at high redshift.

True. So make clearer that this is a first round, and that only in
the next round will our sample become bigger.
Now we are just showing preliminary results for a subsample.

Use bold face and 10% larger labels

I had failed to notice this.
In fact, I would add to make sure the h/m/s, d/m/s columns are aligned too.

OK, say something.

Good question.
Answer that this is to avoid one more complication.
But in future work we plan to use different definitions for L and
compare the results. A halo escape velocity in the Likelihood function
is one of the options.

See above: it is not apriori clear that multiple components near one
galaxy are the same cloud or no.
We will need to make both assumptions and compare.
For now we do the simple thing: treat all lines as independent.

OK, add reference.
Also to H.W- Chen, who normalized using luminosity (see ref in W&S09)

I don't think that is easy.

"Should know" does not mean "knows". So, keep it.
Especially relevant to keep it so that non-experienced astronomers
who start looking at this can realize it.

OIV=OVI

You did look at this. Dig that out and add a note.

?
108 is 2 sigma away from 68
245 is 2 sigma away from 329
So I don't understand the "1 sigma".
You can't look at 68+16=84 an 108-20=88 and say they are 1 sigma
apart. The probability of both being off (in different directions)
multiplies, so the probabiliy having both actual values be 86 is
0.31*0.31=0.09, which is 1.8 sigma.

Huh - the azimuth distribution is one of the things we were going
to look at. That the sample is not quite large enough and that the
distribution is more or less flat is just what is the case.

Let's think about this.
