echo "HImodel gives measurements - vel, FWHM, column density (10^18), error in NHI, deuterium abundance, component classification, notes, notes about where it comes from

model comes from:
1. 21cm  components when things are strong, sometimes use Lybeta wings to make those fit - lots of degeneracy between FWHM and NHI - this gives the basic profile
2. Sometimes you can see the components in the FUV spectra
3. Current measurements are by fitting the model by eye
4. metal lines and other things sometimes makes it more difficult, have to fit those as well (mostly a widening of the HI profile is a result of metals). In other words you may not actually see an HI component, but can't fit without adding a component there

Galactic absorption also has deuterium (abundance 10^-5) so 10^20 HI -> 10^15 deuterium occurs at -80 km/s, may get covered by an HI component that is also at this velocity

5. Fit the 923 line continuum then copy that 
6. y is fit continuum
7. h is read in continuum and add HI model and H2 model
8. for stronger components look at CII and SiIII to see if you can find any component structure (such as what is the width? - HI profiles tend to be wider though)
9. Sometimes COS data helps, H2 is already fit in Bart's 2006 paper ('h' command already includes that and lists its' value)

I need to:
reassess the component structure (need to add or remove any components? probably 85%  need to stay that are already there)
reassess the continuum fit
use night only data (put capital 'N' at end of source name e.g., MRK335 -> MRK335N)
try to do a real fit

Pay attention to Oxygen lines which have a similar set of transitions (outer electrons of O, lines shift around a bit, tend to be around -400km/s relative to HI)
Lya continuum goes all the way to ~3500 km/s from 0, there is the damping wings
