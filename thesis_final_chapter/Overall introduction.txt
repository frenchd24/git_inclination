Overall introduction:

What are the questions I want answered? - Does gas care about galaxies?
1. How do absorber properties depend on galaxy properties?
2. Co-rotation?
3. Missing baryons question? X-ray possibly solved this, detecting hot gas in halos traced by OVII, OVIII, NeVIII (others?)
4. Where are the metals?

Look at morphology dependence
CDF for b parameter for each subset


EW distribution (CDF):
These Lya lines are photoionized. More nearby galaxies should result in a stronger ionizing photo field, which should result in weaker Lya lines (or perhaps just fewer weak lines? Would the strong lines still be there?). The most likely explanation for this EW dependence is turbulence.

What does EW and Doppler-b actually tell you about Lya? - include this somewhere

Bouche et al 2013: "Galaxies are thought to be fed by the continuous accretion of intergalactic gas, but direct observational evidence has been elusive. The accreted gas is expected to orbit about the galaxyâ€™s halo, delivering not just fuel for star formation but also angular momentum to the galaxy, leading to distinct kinematic signatures. We report observations showing these distinct signatures near a typical distant star-forming galaxy, where the gas is detected using a background quasar passing 26 kiloparsecs from the host."
