Pittsburgh talk outline:

1) this is work I’m doing with my advisor, Bart. It’s some of the results from a pilot study

2) General idea: COS-Halos, etc., look at the CGM-galaxy connection at higher redshift. We’d like to look at lower redshift, so that we can take advantage of an already available, complete galaxy sample. 

	- Big questions = How do the properties of absorbers (velocity, EW, azimuth) and the properties of galaxies (inclination, size, type) correlate?

3) We started the survey by selecting 35 sightlines. 1) What are the largest 50 galaxies within 500 kpc of a sightline, then which of these has S/N >10? Take the top 35

4) Another issue we wanted to address is reproducibility - how to choose a galaxy?
	- likelihood method

5) Results

6) There’s a difference between red and blue shifted absorbers, but we’re not sure why. We are getting some rotation curves, to see if this has something to do with it.

7) Next step is to increase the sample size - reduce more sightlines
