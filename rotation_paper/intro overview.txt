Kimm 2011 - AMR simulations find low filamentary cold gas accretion results in very low covering fraction, making observational detection difficult (z~1.5)

Shen 2013 - Elis simulations of the CGM, showing 'cold' streams penetrate deep into the viral radius, are not affect by outflows. OVI halo of near unity covering fraction out to 150 kpc.
