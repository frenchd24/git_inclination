\section{INTRODUCTION}
Galaxy rotation curves have been observed to extend at constant velocity out to... (cite...). It becomes increasingly difficult to measure gas rotation much farther from this however as the density rapidly decreases. Within this region the galaxy disks transition into circumgalactic medium (CGM), and eventually the CGM merges with the intergalactic medium (IGM). At what point, however, does the surrounding medium cease to circulate with the galaxy? Stewart et al. (2011) suggests through (HYDRO?) simulations that the bulk CGM kinematics out to (WHAT DISTANCE) may circulate, and that absorption in intervening QSO sightlines should be able to accurately capture this rotation signature.

There have been several studies with a sample size of 1 or a few aiming to compare the kinematics of the galaxy disk to absorption detected in it's CGM halo (e.g., Cote et al. 2005; Wakker \& Savage 2009; Bowen et al. 2016; \textbf{MORE}). With these individual results we may be missing the forest for the sake of the individual trees. There has yet to be a more systematic search for observational evidence that the CGM is kinematically associated with galaxies in general.

Numerous studies have shown a correlation between equivalent width and decreasing velocity difference between galaxies and IGM absorbers (e.g., French \& Wakker 2017, MORE).

To make progress here, we have obtained rotation curves for 12 nearby spiral galaxies which are located within 500 kpc of a background QSO observed by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on \textit{HST}.

\section{DATA AND ANALYSIS}

\subsection{SALT Data}
Our sample contains 12 galaxies observed with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) in longslit mode. These 12 were selected from a larger pool of 48 submitted targets by the SALT observing queue. These 48 possible targets were chosen for their proximity to background QSOs whose spectra contained promising Ly$\alpha$ lines. Finally, we only included galaxies with $z \leq 0.33$ ($cz \leq 10,000$ \kms), angular sizes less than 6' to ensure easy sky subtraction, and surface brightnesses sufficient to keep exposure times below $~1300 s$. Table \ref{salt_targets} summarizes these observations. Data was taken for 2 additional galaxies, NGC3640 and NGC2962, but proved unusable due to issues with spectral identification and low signal to noise (respectively).



%All SALT galaxy spectra were reduced and extracted using the standard PySALT reduction package (\textbf{\begin{table*}[ht]\footnotesize. 


All SALT galaxy spectra were reduced and extracted using the standard PySALT reduction package (\textbf{CITATION}), which includes procedures to prepare the data, correct for gain, cross-talk, bias, and overscan, and finally mosaic the images from different extensions. Next, we rectify the images with wavelength solutions found via Ne and Ar arc lamp spectra line identification. Finally, we perform a basic sky subtraction using an off-sky portion of the image, and extract 5-10 pixel wide 1-D strips from the reduced 2-D spectrum. 

For each 1-D spectrum, we identify the H$\alpha$ emission lines and perform a non-linear least-squares Voigt profile fit using the Python package LMFIT\footnote{\url{http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/python/lmfit/contents.html}}. The line centroid and 1$\sigma$ standard errors are returned, and these fits are then shifted to rest-velocity based on the galaxy systemic redshift and heliocentric velocity corrections are calculated with the IRAF rvcorrect procedure. The final rotation velocity is calculated by then applying the inclination correction, $v_{rot} = v / \sin(i)$. Final errors are calculated as

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\sigma^2 = \left( \frac{\partial v_{rot}}{\partial \lambda_{obs}} \right)^2 (\Delta \lambda_{obs})^2 + \left(\frac{\partial v_{rot}}{\partial v_{sys}} \right)^2 (\Delta v_{sys})^2 + \\
	\left( \frac{\partial v_{rot}}{\partial i} \right)^2 (\Delta i)^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta \lambda_{obs}$, $\Delta v_{sys}$, and $\Delta i$ are the errors in observed line center, galaxy redshift, and inclination, respectively. We determine the inclination error by calculate the standard deviation of all axis ratio values available for each galaxy in NED. The final physical scale is calculated using the SALT image scale of 0.1267 arcsec/pixel, multiplied by the 4-pixel spatial binning, and converted to physical units using a redshift-independent distance if available, and a Hubble flow estimate if not. We adopt a Hubble constant of $H_0$ = 71 \kms $\rm Mpc^{-1}$ throughout.

Finally, we calculate our approaching and receding velocities via a weighted mean of the outer 1/2 of each rotation curve, with errors calculated as weighted standard errors in the mean. Our final redshifts are calculated by forcing symmetric rotation, such that the outer 1/2 average velocity for each side matches. See Figure \ref{rotation_curve} for an example.

\subsection{Ancillary Data}

\section{Halo Rotation Model}
In order to better understand how QSO sightlines probe intervening velocity structure we have developed a simple halo gas rotation model. This model is seeded by an observed rotation curve (or whatever rotation curve-esque data suits ones fancy). This input curve is then interpolated and extended out to 2$R_{vir}$ based on the average velocity of the outer 1/2 radius. Next, we project this interpolated rotation curve onto a plane oriented to a faux QSO sightline identically to the input galaxy-QSO pair orientation. By stacking multiple rotation-planes in the galaxy z-axis direction, we then create a simple cylindrical rotating halo model. Finally, each rotation-plane in the stack is projected onto the faux sightline. The result is a function representing the rotation velocity encountered by the sightline as a function of velocity (or distance) along it.

For each galaxy-QSO pair we created 3 rotation models: 1) a purely cylindrical halo extending 1$R_{vir}$ in height and 2$R_{vir}$ in radius, 2) a spherical halo extending 2$R_{vir}$ in radius, and 3) a cylindrical model extending 1$R_{vir}$ in height and 2$R_{vir}$ in radius with rotation velocities which smoothly decline to systemic towards these boundaries.

The galaxy NGC5987 ($v=3010$ $\rm km\, s^{-1}$, inclination = $65^{\circ}$) can be unambiguously paired with the Ly$\alpha$ absorption features at $v=3090, 3192$ $\rm km\, s^{-1}$ because it is the largest and closest galaxy in both physical and velocity space to the absorption feature.}}
