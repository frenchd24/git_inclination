Overall introduction:

What are the questions I want answered? - Does gas care about galaxies?
1. How do absorber properties depend on galaxy properties?
2. Co-rotation?
3. Missing baryons question? X-ray possibly solved this, detecting hot gas in halos traced by OVII, OVIII, NeVIII (others?)
4. Where are the metals?
