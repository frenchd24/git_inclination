Overall introduction:

What are the questions I want answered? - Does gas care about galaxies?
1. How do absorber properties depend on galaxy properties?
2. Co-rotation?
3. Missing baryons question? X-ray possibly solved this, detecting hot gas in halos traced by OVII, OVIII, NeVIII (others?)
4. Where are the metals?

Look at morphology dependence
CDF for b parameter for each subset


EW distribution (CDF):
These Lya lines are photoionized. More nearby galaxies should result in a stronger ionizing photo field, which should result in weaker Lya lines (or perhaps just fewer weak lines? Would the strong lines still be there?). The most likely explanation for this EW dependence is turbulence.

Check out Hafen, Z. et al 2017 paper - low redshift LLSs as diagnostics of cosmological inflows and outflows

What does EW and Doppler-b actually tell you about Lya? - include this somewhere
