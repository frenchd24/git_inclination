Understanding the influence of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on galaxy evolution requires detailed comparisons between properties of halo gas and associated galaxies. I will present results from an ongoing, large-scale study of the CGM-galaxy connection using archival Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra of background QSOs. We have developed a novel likelihood-based method for connecting CGM absorption with associated galaxies in a reproducible way. We confirm an anti-correlation between Ly-alpha absorber equivalent width and both impact parameter and velocity separation to the nearby galaxy. Further, we find that absorption is detected in excess near galaxies with inclination >60 deg. We present rotation curves from the Southern African Large Telescope for a subset of galaxies, which allow us to probe the connection between disk and halo gas kinematics. Finally, I will present a new, highly-complete catalog of nearby galaxies compiled from NASA Extragalactic Database and NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive, including homogenized galaxy parameters such as distance, diameter, and luminosity for galaxies in the cz < 10,000 km/s redshift window.
